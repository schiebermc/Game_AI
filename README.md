# Game Bots by Matthew Schieber

In pursuit of my passion for Artificial Intelligence, games, and puzzles, I created this repo for personal exploration.  
Each project contains its own directory. Here are short summaries of each project:

* 8-Queens-GA: Solution for the 8-queens problem using genetic algorithms.  
* N-Puzzle: Solution to the N-puzzle using A* search.
* bidding-tic-tac-toe: Game player, wildly different from classical tic-tac-toe with bidding strategies.
* dead-end-isolation: Game player, a variant of isolation.
* maze-escape: Game player, includes general solution to partially-observable maze escape problems, etc.
* pacman: Game player, uses three search variants: A*, BFS, UCS to find food for pacman.
* stock-trader: Game player, employs machine learning on stock data to construct intelligent trading strategies.
* tic-tac-toe: Game player, classical tic-tac-toe using minimax decision making.
* tron: Game player, turn-based two-player tron - minimax with alphabeta pruning decision making.
