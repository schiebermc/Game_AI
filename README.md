# Game Bots by Matthew Schieber

In pursuit of my passion for Artificial Intelligence, games, and puzzles, I created this repo for personal exploration.  
Each project contains its own directory. Here are short summaries of each project:

Visualized Projects (backend tech + visualizations)
* 8-Queens-GA: Solution for the 8-queens problem using genetic algorithms.  
* N-Puzzle: interactive N-puzzle game board with automated solutions using A* search.
* traveling-salesman: Framework, test cases, and solvers to TSP. 
* pong: interactive pong player

Non-Visualized Projects (just the backend tech)
* battleship: Game player, uses probabilistic decision making. written in C++
* bidding-game: Game player, bidding tug of war.
* bidding-tic-tac-toe: Game player, tic-tac-toe with bidding strategies.
* checkers: Game player, alpha-beta pruning written in C++.
* connect-4: Game player, with simulation engine, written in python.
* dead-end-isolation: Game player, a variant of isolation.
* maze-escape: Game player, includes general solution to partially-observable maze escape problems, etc.
* pacman: Game player, uses three search variants: A*, BFS, UCS to find food for pacman.
* tic-tac-toe: Game player, classical tic-tac-toe using minimax decision making.
* tron: Game player, turn-based two-player tron - minimax with alphabeta pruning decision making.
