# PONG

Welcome to Pong!

I created an interactive pong game using pygame.  Up to four players are possible, with at most one human player. 

Here is a simple version of what one player looks like:

![](figures/1p_demo.mov)

Most parameters can be easily modified, including player board size, ball size, speed, etc:
![](figures/adjusted_parameters.mov)

I also implemented computer players! You can find the cpu logic in `players.py`. Here is a 2-player example:
